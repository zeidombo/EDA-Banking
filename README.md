Welcome to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of customer demographics and banking behaviors project! 

## Project Overview
In this project, we applied EDA techniques to a dataset from the banking industry using the Pandas library in Python. The goal of the project was to gain a deeper understanding of the data and identify any trends, patterns, or issues present. The analysis focused on features such as customer demographics, banking behaviors, and economic indicators.

## File Descriptions
The project includes the following files:

`eda_banking_data.ipynb`: This is the main Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and results of the EDA.
`bank-additional-full.csv`: This is the dataset used for the analysis. It includes information on customer demographics and banking behaviors.

## Results
The results of the EDA are summarized in the Jupyter Notebook. Some key findings include:

The majority of the bank's customers are in the age range of 30-50, and are primarily employed in white collar jobs.
A significant proportion of customers have defaulted on their loans in the past, indicating a potential risk for the bank.
The duration of contact and number of campaigns seem to have a positive impact on the success of marketing campaigns, while the outcome of previous campaigns does not appear to have a strong relationship.
Economic indicators such as the employment rate and consumer price index are correlated with customer behaviors such as account balance and number of transactions.
These findings can be used by the bank to inform their business decisions, such as targeted marketing campaigns and risk assessments for loan approvals.

## Next Steps
While the EDA has provided a solid foundation for understanding the data, there may be further steps that could be taken to more fully understand the implications of the trends and patterns identified. These could include additional analysis or experimentation to confirm or expand upon the results of the EDA.
